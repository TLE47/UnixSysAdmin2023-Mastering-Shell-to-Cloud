### Equipment requirements: 
- CPU: ARM-based Mac (M1/M2) or Mac/PC with 7th generation or newer Intel Core / AMD CPUs - VMware’s CPU requirements at https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/51643
(not recommended no "Celeron" or "Atom" CPUs)
- RAM: **8 GB minimum**, 16 GB or more recommended
- Disk Storage : **~120 GB** free storage space (need more space? $30-40 will get you 500GB of portable USB3 disk
**for the best experience use an internal SSD, if you can afford it**)

- **Hypervisor**:
  - For Intel/AMD - CPU , we'll use VMware
  - For Intel Macs - VMware Fusion
  - For ARM Macs - download UTM for Macs https://mac.getutm.app/

P/S: If you buy a new PC/Laptop, try to get something with a Windows “Pro” license, not “Home.”
